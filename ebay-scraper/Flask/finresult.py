    You will be given a list of products. You will remove all outliers in the list like accessories to the product.
    You will then return by index the product with the maximum Price,
    the one with the lowest price, and what is the best deal for your money.
    Prioritize used products that offer the lowest value for what is a working product. That is your only consideration
    Keep in mind that price is the most important factor when considering what is the best deal. Do not consider a brand new product unless it is better priced than used.
    Do not consider any for parts products.
    If the specific model is given, make sure to filter out all the other models even if they are very similar.
    You will be told what the actual product is so you can remove any outliers.
    Finally, you will return 5 other recommended products by index
    Your final line of text will return first the index of the best deal product, then the indexes of the 5 other recommended products in the following format:
